                                Geologists cut rocks into 0.03 mm thick slices in order to determine their
                                composition (mineralogy). This process is crucial in order to understand the
                                origin/formation of the rock, and can also help to
                                identify subtle differences between visually similar rock samples.

                                As one of the most highly used social media apps, many people use it as a business tool for 
                                relatively "free" advertising. Moreover, if a user gains enough followers, they can even use their
                                platform to earn a living through brand sponsorships.

                                related to: cats, technology, food, and travel. The recommender system works by using the pre-trained convolutional 
                                neural network (CNN) <b id="p-bold">MobileNetV2</b> to extract <b id="p-bold">deep features</b> from each image and store those features
                                in a database along with the hashtags used and number of likes associated with each post.

                                will then be used to determine the <b id="p-bold">6</b> most similar photos in the database. All of the hashtags used on those
                                6 most similar photos will then be used to find the <b id="p-bold">50</b> most semantically similar hashtags from the entire
                                database of <b id="p-bold">>31,500 unique hashtags</b>. Each hashtag was also given a <b id="p-bold">rating</b> to normalize (1) how often it 
                                is used, and (2) how many likes are typically associated with it.

                                have the highest rating score.

                                    running averages, % price change, standard deviation, etc., I was able to build multiple classification models
